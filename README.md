This is an incomplete project that I had to stop working on due to the situation in Russia. 
The project is about a personal ATM that utilizes the cash dispenser POOLON LCDM1000 and ESP32 microcontroller. It operates through the Telegram messenger.
The use case scenario is for employee payouts at a local hair salon.
